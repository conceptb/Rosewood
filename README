The Rosewood Gaming Engine
For all your browser-based gaming needs, without the flash.

Open rwtest.html or one of the examples in a browser to see a little of what it can do.

All the game logic for rwtest.html is in game.js, check it out.

Read docs.html for info (well, not much at the moment, sometimes it's hard to believe that I'm the child of a Technical Writer)

The engine is in the aptly titled rosewood.js file, if you feel like tinkering.

The biggest goal of Rosewood, aside from becoming the best 2d javascript gaming engine out there, is eventual support for multiplayer features, using node.js or something of the like.

Feel free to drop me a line if you want to contribute or whatnot.

Enjoy!
