		<h1>The Rosewood Gaming Engine</h1>
		<h3>Ver 0.0.01a</h3>
		<h2>What is this madness?</h2>
		<h3>The Basics</h3>
		<p>The Rosewood Engine is a simple engine/framework for creating 2D, sprite-based games in javascript. Due to the limitations of current javascript engines, Rosewood is most suited for creating games in a style similar to those of the early 1990s (eg. Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis). Games created with Rosewood can be played in any moderately standards-compliant web browser ( Firefox, Chrome, Opera & Safari should do fine, maybe IE7+, but probably not IE6).</p>
		<h3>The Details</h3>
		<p>At its core, Rosewood is a Javascript Library, wrapped in an Object called 'rw'. The rw Object contains built-in functions for creating game menus, an animated runtime environment with collision detection and in-game overlays. The rw API allows for quick keybinding and animation controls and can be extended with new game logic. As of right now, Rosewood only has built-in support for top-down style gaming, but support for platform games is coming.</p>
		<h3>The Future</h3>
		<p>Server-side storage and AJAX calls are planned for the future as well as multiplayer support. Currently, Rosewood does not support canvas, but this may change.</p>
		<h2>Current Version</h2>
		<h3>Demo</h3>
		<p>You can view a very simple demo of Rosewood <a href="rosewood.html">here</a>.Customize your character then explore. The arrow keys move your character, 't' key to talk to people, 'i' key to view the menu and the 'a' key to close a window. The demo uses sprites from the SNES game Chrono Trigger.
		<h3>Download</h3>
		<p>Rosewood is currently in a pre-beta stage, lets say Version 0.0.01a. You can download a tarball <a href="rosewood_0.0.01b.tar.gz">here</a></p>
		<h3>Documentation</h3>
		<p>It's skimpy, but <a href="api.html">here</a> it is.</p>
