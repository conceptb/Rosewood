Path to a NEW Rosewood:
	!!!remove ent.keyChange from ents loop, give own loop?
	ent children &/| ent's as canvas
	multiline support for ent text
	!!!redo all collision and gotHit stuff, ent sends info to what it hits
	new collisions precalced tree + b tree
	possibly redo hitmaps, add/rem with functions, store in base
	websockets, integrate with the ajax slot of runloop
	sound mixing and whatnot support
	Mouse as a hitmap?
	? add mobile input
	? re-add div based rendering
	? give tiles some love
	X fix mouse
	X raw canvas drawing
	X rw.run composting on init
	X modular run components
	X ajax slot of runloop
	X(kinda) ajax POST, and whatnot


How to redo collision detection:
	Every ent gets an array of what it can hit, generated at creation
		and appended on creation/destruction of other ents
	B-Tree after array positive on collision detec.

------BUGS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

triangular collision detec fucks up when you have 0 as a value in the hitMap,
	solution == redo hitmaps to be internal and pre-calc'd
