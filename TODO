Path to a NEW Rosewood:
	X rw.run composting on init
	X modular run components
	fix mouse
	X ajax slot of runloop
	!!!remove ent.keyChange from ents loop, give own loop?
	!!!redo all collision and gotHit stuff, ent sends info to what it hits
	ajax POST, and whatnot
	websockets, integrate with the ajax slot of runloop
	new collisions precalced tree + b tree
	sound mixing and whatnot support
	ent children &/| ent's as canvas
	raw canvas drawing
	multiline support for ent text
	possibly redo hitmaps, add/rem with functions, store in base
	? add mobile input
	? re-add div based rendering
	? give tiles some love


How to redo collision detection:
	Every ent gets an array of what it can hit, generated at creation
		and appended on creation/destruction of other ents
	B-Tree after array positive on collision detec.

------BUGS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

triangular collision detec fucks up when you have 0 as a value in the hitMap,
	solution == redo hitmaps to be internal and pre-calc'd
