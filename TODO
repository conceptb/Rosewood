BUGS

Sound support died after using a bunch of bombs in bman clone, in chrome.

It appears that rw.key(key) will return false for a key that is pressed every few frames
	this has happened on my machine in FF and Chrome
	it seems to happen when ent.base.move is used, as it doesn't show up in the bman game,
	which uses the old ent.base.velX/velY tricks for setting vel.
