Path to a NEW Rosewood:
	X rw.run composting on init
	X modular run components
	? re-add div based rendering
	? add mobile input
	fix mouse
	ajax (general, ent & rule) and ajax pahes of runloop
	new collisions precalced tree + b tree
	sound mixing and whatnot support
	ent children &/| ent's as canvas
	raw canvas drawing
	multiline support for ent text
	possibly redo hitmaps, add/rem with fuunctions, store in base
	? give tiles some love


How to redo collision detection:
	Every ent gets an array of what it can hit, generated at creation
		and appended on creation/destruction of other ents
	B-Tree after array positive on collision detec.
