------UPCOMING CHANGES---------------------------------------------------------------------------

re-do map.offset to be ent.move and ent.moveTo

Canvas support someday

------POSSIBLE CHANGES---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possibly prepend "ent_" to all ent.base.names, for (marginally) faster runtime

Ent Groups? Or, fuck that, that's what rules are for.

Leading us to:
	Split rules into three categories? Before ent update loop, before ent collision loop and normal rule time?

find mouse pos based on "board" div's location - You would think this wouldn't be so hard...

Node.js server support someday soon

Add audio mixing support

------BUGS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sound support died after using a bunch of bombs in bman clone, in chrome.

It appears that rw.key(key) will return false for a key that is pressed every few frames
	this has happened on my machine in FF and Chrome
	it seems to happen when ent.base.move is used, as it doesn't show up in the bman game,
	which uses the old ent.base.velX/velY tricks for setting vel.
