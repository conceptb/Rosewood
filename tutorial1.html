<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Intro</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: medium;">For the longest time if you wanted to create a browser-based video game you had one choice, Adobe's Flash platform. Flash works quite well for making games but their are drawbacks, namely the cost of purchasing Adobe software and the closed-nature of the platform. With the advent of faster scripting engines in modern browsers it is now becoming possible to create games using Javascript. This method also has its drawbacks, from lack of support for sounds to cross-browser issues, but it is at least accessable to everyone who has a web browser and a text editor. And even if gaming is not Javascript's strong suit, a lot can be learned about the language in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; In this tutorial, we are going to begin making an engine for the creation of games with javascript. Why an engine and not just a game? Because there are a lot of functions that most games share in common and creating an engine will allow us to understand many of the basic concepts behind game design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; This tutorial aims to fully explain what we are creating and therefore should be easy enough to follow along with, but some amount of prior experience with javascript, html and css will be helpful. If you don't know what a div is or the css background-image property, you probably want to read up on the basics at somewhere like <a title="w3schools" href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> otherwise, read on.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; As browsers begin to implement the HTML5 specifications the new 'canvas' element is gaining quite a bit of attention, especially for applications like gaming. Using javascript, canvas allows us to create an kind of vector based images imaginable. For this example we are not going to be using canvas, instead focusing on javascript's ability to manipulate an element's css properties, thereby enabling animation. This is not to knock canvas, it has a bright future, however it is still relatively slow and does not render in all browsers (I'm looking at you Internet Explorer).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Beginning</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; Before we do anything, you're going to need a few handy tools and a basic file structure. Make sure you have your favorite web browser and text editor ready. Any browser should work, though I reccomend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. For a text editor, you'll want one that at least has syntax highlighting features for html and javascript. If you're a Windows user, I'd suggest Notepad++, if you're on a Mac, TextWrangler is probably your best bet and if you've got a Linux box, you probably don't need me telling you what text editor to use, but you can't go wrong with vim, emacs or Geany (for the non-masochists).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; Now let's create a file structure, assuming you have a folder where you keep programming projects, open it up and create a new folder called 'game' or something of the like. Inside the game folder, create another folder called 'sprites', this is where we will store images for our game. Now open up your text editor and create and save two new files in the game folder named 'index.html' and 'game.js'. 'index.html' is the HTML file that will run our game and 'game.js' is an external javascript where we will create the game. Everything is now ready, so let's dive in!</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Setting up the HTML file</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; First things first, let's open up our 'index.html' file in the text editor and create a basic web page. </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, we've got a pretty basic web page here, a head, a body and a link in the head to our 'game.js' script. We've also created a second script element in the body for calling the game when the page loads. Easy peasy, now save the file and let's move on to the javascript.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we'll open up the 'game.js' file and start working on the engine. Because our engine is going to have a lot of functions and properties, we want to keep it self contained to avoid filling up the global namespace. Also, creating lots of global variables is a bad idea when it comes to memory management so we'll initialize our engine as a single object. <br /></span></span></span></p>
