rw object:
	The rw Object holds all variables and functions of the Rosewood Engine. 
	In addition, every entity and barrier is kept in arrays inside of the rw Object.

ent.update():
	every entity within the rw.ents array must have an update function. 
	This function is called once every framecycle and controls most, 
	if not all of an entity's actions within the game. 
	If update() returns false, the ent will be removed from rw.ents.
		If ent.base.hide() has not been called before update() returns false, 
		the ent's sprite will remain.
