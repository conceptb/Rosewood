		<h1>Rosewood Documentation</h1>
		<h2>Introduction to the Rosewood Engine</h2>
		<p>Add basic overview of the engine</p>
		<h2>The Board</h2>
		<h3>Basics</h3>
		<p>
			When Rosewood is initialized, it creates an html div with the id 'board'.
			The board serves as the DOM parentNode for all backgrounds, sprites and 
			invisible barriers within the game.
		</p>
		<h2>Entities</h2>
		<h3>Entity Basics</h3>
		<p>
			Entities (hereforth know as 'ents') form the core of the Rosewood engine.
			Every non-background object that is append to the game board is initialized
			as an ent. All sprites, Characters, Enemies, Items and any invisble barriers
			or specific areas within the board are created using the rw.newEnt function
			and tracked within the rw.ents array.
		</p>
		<p>
			A large portion of game design with Rosewood is creating custom ent
			definitions for the objects witin the game. however there are a number of 
			properties and functions that all ents share.
		</p>
		<h4>ent.base and rw.ent</h4>
		<p>
			Every ent is created with a custom constructor function written for the 
			specific game, but every ent constructor must have certain properties.
			In order to be considered valid by the engine an ent must possess a property 
			named 'base' that references an rw.ent object. In other words, an ent
			named 'ent' would have a property 'ent.base' that would refer to an
			rw.ent object.
			The rw.ent object, by way of ent.base contains much of the information that
			all ents share. Properties within rw.ent are read by the engine to determine
			the dimensions and location of each entity as well as what sprites to
			represent them with onscreen.
			At a minimum, an ent MUST have an rw.ent object assigned to its 'base' property.
		</p>
		<h5>rw.ent properties</h5>
		<p>
			The rw.ent object contains the properties used by the engine for positioning and
			displaying entities onscreen. They are stored within an ent's 'base' property.
			The ent.base properties inherited from rw.ent are as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.name</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.typeClass</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.sprites</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.spritesSct</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.width</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.height</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.posX, posY and posZ</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.velX, velY and velZ</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.heading</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.moving</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.active</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.display()</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.hide()</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>ent.base.changeSprite(spriteName)</strong>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>ent.update() and ent.iGotHit()</h4>
		<p>
			While not necessary for validation, ents must have an 'update()' function
			if they are to be moved onscreen after initial placement.
			The engin runs at a specified rate of frames per second; in each frame,
			the update() function of every ent is called and if the ent moves, it is 
			re-positioned onscreen.
			In addition to the update() function, ents can also have a function called
			'iGotHit()' which contains instructions for how an entity should react if it
			collides with another entity. When two ents collide their 'ent.base.typeClass'
			value is passed to the other ent's iGotHit() funtion like so: 
				ent.iGotHit(otherEnt.base.typeClass)
			This allows the game designer to specify different behavior for an ent running
			into a wall as opposed to say, the ent being hit by a bullet.
		</p>
		<h3>rw.ents Array</h3>
		<p>
			Rosewood stores every game entity (or 'ent') within the rw.ents array.
			When a new ent is created using the rw.newEnt() function it is appended
			to the end of the array.
			This means, that as ents are created and removed the array index of a 
			given ent may change, making it difficult to refer to a specific ent 
			using its location within the array.
			However, this shortcoming is easily mitigated by crafting an ent's 
			properties and functions in a way that does not rely on an absolute 
			index within the rw.ents array.
			In addition, the <strong>rules</strong> object provides methods of directly 
			interfacing with specific ents. See the Rules section for more details.

		<h1>Tutorial</h1>
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<h3>Set Up</h3>
		<p>
			To start creating a game with Rosewood we first need to grab a copy of 
			the engine and set up a project directory.
			Create a folder for the game and place a copy of rosewood.js to it.
			Then, using your favorite text-editor, create a file called 'mygame.js'
			and another called 'game.html'.
