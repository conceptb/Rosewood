<h2>Ents</h2>
<p>
	Of the 3 main object classes that rosewood uses, ents are the most important. 
	Every non-background sprite you create in your game must be an ent object.
	For Rosewood to work properly with an ent, it must have certain properties.
	Usually you would want to write an object constructor for each class of ent in your game.
	An ent constructor function, in its simplest form is shown below.

	var simpleEnt = function(name, width, height,) {
		this.base = new rw.ent(name, 'simpleEnt', 'guy', 'gif', width, height);
		this.update = function() {
		}
	}

	Let's step through the code for this simple object constructor and review what it does. 
	This function, simpleEnt, accepts 3 arguments, a name, a width and a height; and creates an ent of the class 'simpleEnt'.
	The first property created within the new simpleEnt is the 'base' property.
	This property is asssigned a 'new rw.ent' object as its value.
	All ents MUST have an 'rw.ent' object assigned to the property 'base'.
	rw.ent is an object constructor function, that creates a Rosewood entity object.
	These objects store things such as an entitiy's position and graphics.
	If an entity does not have an rw.ent as its 'base' property, the engine will not be able to work with the entity.
	Th rw.ent function accepts a number of variables, they are as follows:
		name: The Entity's name (this must be unique!)
		typeClass: The entity's type.
		img: The path to the entity's sprites (blank if the entity is invisible)
		ext: The file type of the entity's sprites (gif, png, etc) (blank if invisible)
		width: The entity's width, in pixels
		height: The entity's height, in pixels
	In the example above, the rw.ent is given the following values: 
		The ent's name is the argument given to the function, its typeClass is 'simpleEnt',
		the sprites for the ent are in the folder 'guy' and are 'gif's and the width and height are
		specified in the function's arguments.
