		<h2>Introduction to the Rosewood Engine</h2>
		<p>Add basic overview of the engine</p>
		<h2>The Board</h2>
		<h3>Basics</h3>
		<p>
			When Rosewood is initialized, it creates an html div with the id 'board'.
			The board serves as the DOM parentNode for all backgrounds, sprites and 
			invisible barriers within the game.
		</p>
		<h2>Entities</h2>
		<h3>Entity Basics</h3>
		<p>
			Entities (hereforth know as 'ents') form the core of the Rosewood engine.
			Every non-background object that is append to the game board is initialized
			as an ent. All sprites, Characters, Enemies, Items and any invisble barriers
			or specific areas within the board are created using the rw.newEnt function
			and tracked within the rw.ents array.
		</p>
		<p>
			A large portion of game design using Rosewood is creating custom ent
			definitions for the objects witin the game. however there are a number of 
			properties and functions that all ents share.
		</p>
		<h4>ent.base and rw.ent</h4>
		<p>
			Every ent is created with a custom object constructor function written for 
			the specific game, but every ent constructor must create certain properties.
			Ents must possess the property 'base' that contains an rw.ent object to
			be considered valid by the engine.
			In addition, if an ent is to much of anything it must have an update() 
			function and potentially an iGotHit() function for collision detection.
		</p>
		<h3>rw.ents Array</h3>
		<p>
			Rosewood stores every game entity (or 'ent') within the rw.ents array.
			When a new ent is created using the rw.newEnt() function it is appended
			to the end of the array.
			This means, that as ents are created and removed the array index of a 
			given ent may change, making it difficult to refer to a specific ent 
			using its location within the array.
			However, this shortcoming is easily mitigated by crafting an ent's 
			properties and functions in a way that does not rely on an absolute 
			index within the rw.ents array.
			In addition, the <strong>rules</strong> object provides methods of directly 
			interfacing with specific ents. See the Rules section for more details.

		<h1>Tutorial</h1>
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<h3>Set Up</h3>
		<p>
			To start creating a game with Rosewood we first need to grab a copy of 
			the engine and set up a project directory.
			Create a folder for the game and place a copy of rosewood.js to it.
			Then, using your favorite text-editor, create a file called 'mygame.js'
			and another called 'game.html'.
